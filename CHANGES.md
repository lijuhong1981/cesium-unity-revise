### v1.6.0

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for Universal Windows Platform (UWP), which is required to build applications for the Holo Lens 2.
- Added `ComputeLoadProgress` function to estimate the percentage of the 3D tileset that has been loaded for the current view.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that prevented building on iOS.
- Fixed a bug where KTX tilesets did not display properly on iOS devices due to a missing check for ETC1 texture format.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.26.0 to v0.27.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.5.0 - 2023-08-01

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that could lead to incorrect textures when a KTX2 image did not include a complete mip chain.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.25.1 to v0.26.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.4.0 - 2023-07-03

##### Additions :tada:

- Added `OnTileGameObjectCreated` event to `Cesium3DTileset` class, which allows customizing the Tile GameObjects as they are loaded.
- KTX2 compressed textures now remain compressed all the way to the GPU, reducing GPU memory usage.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed how the occlusion strength is used in the default tileset shader which was causing shadows to be too dark.
- Fixed a bug that caused a prefab with a `CesiumGlobeAnchor` to lose its position after save/reload.
- Fixed a `MissingReferenceException` when entering Play mode with "Domain Reload" disabled. This would also prevent tilesets with raster overlays from appearing at all in Play mode.

### v1.3.1 - 2023-06-06

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that prevented building on iOS.

### v1.3.0 - 2023-06-01

##### Additions :tada:

- Cesium components now appear under the "Cesium" category in the Component menu. Previously were under "Scripts > Cesium for Unity"
- Cesium components now display the Cesium logo as their icon, rather than the default Unity script icon.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug where `Cesium3DTileset` would not reflect changes made to the properties of its opaque material in the Editor.
- Fixed a bug that could cause missing textures when using two raster overlays with the same projection on a single tileset.
- Fixed a bug where changing the origin on a `CesiumGeoreference` would not propogate these changes to the active `CesiumSubScene`, if one exists.
- Reduced the amount of extraneous camera rotation in the `CesiumCameraController` after a frame hitch by using `Time.smoothDeltaTime`.
- Fixed a bug that caused mipmaps to be generated for textures that shouldn't be mipmapped, sometimes leading to cracks between tiles and other problems.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.24.0 to v0.25.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.2.0 - 2023-05-09

##### Additions :tada:

- Added a `scale` property to `CesiumGeoreference`. This allows the entire globe to be scaled up or down with better precision than the scale property on the georeference's `Transform`.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that caused tiles to be displaced when changing the transform of a `CesiumGeoreference` at runtime.
- Fixed a bug that caused primitive numbers to be negative in the names of tile game objects when the tile mesh had multiple primitives.

### v1.1.0 - 2023-05-01

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- `CesiumObjectPool` is no longer accessible from outside the CesiumRuntime assembly.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for primitives with the `TRIANGLE_STRIP` and `TRIANGLE_FAN` topology types.
- Missing normals are now generated as "flat" normals by default, as required by the glTF specification. An option on `Cesium3DTileset` allows the user to request smooth normals instead, which will improve performance for most meshes by reducing geometry duplication.
- Moved mipmap generation from the main thread to a worker thread.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Added dependencies on the ShaderGraph and InputSystem packages to resolve material / script compilation errors.
- Fixed another bug where `CesiumCameraController` tried to access a non-existent input in the legacy input system.
- Removed an extra "delimiter" added to the end of on-screen credits in some cases.
- Fixed a memory leak of `Mesh` objects when entering and exiting Play mode in the Unity Editor.
- Fixed a crash that happened when attempting to create physics meshes for degenerate triangle meshes.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.23.0 to v0.24.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v1.0.0 - 2023-04-03

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for Unity's built-in render pipeline.
- Added `CesiumPointCloudShading`, which allows point cloud tilesets to be rendered with attenuation based on geometric error. Attenuation is currently only supported in the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).
- `GameObject` instances created for the tiles in a `Cesium3DTileset` now inherit the `layer` of the parent tileset.
- Added the `CesiumTileExcluder` abstract class. By creating a class derived from `CesiumTileExcluder`, then adding it to a `Cesium3DTileset`'s game object, you can implement custom rules for excluding tiles in the `Cesium3DTileset` from loading and rendering.
- Added setting in `CesiumRuntimeSettings` to configure the maximum number of responses to keep in the request cache.
- Added setting in `CesiumRuntimeSettings` to configure the number of reads from the cache database before each prune.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that prevented the use of pre-existing mipmaps, such as those loaded from KTX2.
- Fixed a bug where `CesiumCameraController` tried to access non-existent inputs in the legacy input system.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when using the search box with a dataset already selected in the Cesium ion Assets window.
- Fixed a bug that prevented sorting the contents of the Cesium ion Assets window in descending order.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.22.1 to v0.23.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v0.3.1

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug introduced in v0.3.0 that caused an exception when attempting load Cesium3DTilesets from a local file.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.22.0 to v0.22.1. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v0.3.0

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Removed the `positionAuthority`, `unityX`, `unityY`, and `unityZ` properties from `CesiumGlobeAnchor`. Also removed the `SetPositionUnity` method.
- Removed the `CesiumGlobeAnchorPositionAuthority` enum. The authoritative position is now always found in the `positionGlobeFixed` property. The object's Unity world position can be obtained from its `Transform`.
- Marked the `longitude`, `latitude`, and `height` properties on `CesiumGlobeAnchor` as obsolete. Use the `longitudeLatitudeHeight` property instead.
- Marked the `ecefX`, `ecefY`, and `ecefZ` properties on `CesiumGlobeAnchor` as obsolete. Use the `positionGlobeFixed` property instead.
- Marked `SetPositionLongitudeLatitudeHeight` and `SetPositionEarthCenteredEarthFixed` methods on `CesiumGlobeAnchor` as obsolete. Set the `longitudeLatitudeHeight` or `positionGlobeFixed` property instead.
- Replaced `MetadataProperty` with `CesiumFeature`. Metadata features are now separated based on feature tables where properties are accessed by name.
- Replaced `CesiumMetadata.GetProperties` with `CesiumMetadata.GetFeatures`, which returns an array of `CesiumFeature`s.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added support for rendering point clouds (`pnts`).
- `CesiumGlobeAnchor` now stores a precise, globe-relative orientation and scale in addition to position.
- Added `localToGlobeFixedMatrix`, `longitudeLatitudeHeight`, `positionGlobeFixed`, `rotationGlobeFixed`, `rotationEastUpNorth`, `scaleGlobeFixed`, and `scaleEastUpNorth` properties to `CesiumGlobeAnchor`.
- Added the `Restart` method to `CesiumGlobeAnchor`, which can be use to reinitialize the component from its serialized values.
- Moved the Cesium tileset shaders from the `Shader Graphs` shader category to the new `Cesium` shader category.
- Added `CesiumDebugColorizeTilesRasterOverlay` to visualize how a tileset is divided into tiles.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that prevented caching of 3D Tiles and overlay requests.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the Cesium ion Token Troubleshooting panel to crash the Unity Editor.
- Added a workaround for a crash in the Burst Compiler (bcl.exe) in Unity 2022.2 when using il2cpp.
- Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect metadata to be associated with a feature, especially in Draco-encoded tiles.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.21.3 to v0.22.0. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v0.2.0

##### Breaking Changes :mega:

- Renamed `CesiumTransforms` to `CesiumWgs84Ellipsoid`.

##### Additions :tada:

- Added `CesiumCameraController`, a globe-aware controller that adapts its speed and clipping planes based on its height from the globe.
- Added `CesiumFlyToController`, a controller that can smoothly fly to locations across the globe.
- Added an option to add a `DynamicCamera` from the Cesium panel to the scene. The `DynamicCamera` contains `CesiumCameraController` and `CesiumFlyToController` components and offers easy navigation of the globe.
- Added support for building to iOS.
- Added support for building to Android x86-64 devices like the Magic Leap 2.

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug where `CesiumGeoreference`, `CesiumGlobeAnchor`, and `CesiumSubScene` would not properly update when their values were changed by undos or pasted values.
- `CesiumRuntimeSettings` is now stored in `Assets/CesiumSettings/Resources` instead of `Assets/Settings/Resources`.
- Added an explicit `Physics.SyncTransforms` when `CesiumOriginShift` activates or deactivates sub-scenes, avoiding a brief period of potentially very incorrect collisions.

In addition to the above, this release updates [cesium-native](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native) from v0.21.1 to v0.21.3. See the [changelog](https://github.com/CesiumGS/cesium-native/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for a complete list of changes in cesium-native.

### v0.1.2

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that caused Cesium for Unity to fail to compile in Unity 2022.2 and potentially in other scenarios.
- Fixed a bug that led to an exception when the project name included characters outside the printable ASCII range.

### v0.1.1

##### Fixes :wrench:

- Fixed a bug that caused raster overlay tiles to be missing or mixed up, especially when zooming in close and then back out.

### v0.1.0
